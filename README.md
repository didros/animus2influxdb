# animus2influxdb
This program exports sensor information from Animushome Heart and push it in an InfluxDB (version 1.7), so it can be shown in Grafana for instance. 

Current version supports sensors of type temperature, humudity ("MultiLevelSensor") and presence ("BooleanSensor"). Additional types can be easily supported. Program uses Heart websocket so information is received in real time (no poooling).

# Prereq

## Node and pm2
You need node.js (https://nodejs.org) to run the program. 
Optionaly, use pm2 when to are ready to go live in "production" to manage the process (unless you want to do it another way).

## InfluxDB 1.7
You need an influxDB version 1.7 to write data to. Nb! version 2.0 is not supported. InfluxDB does not need to run on the same machine than Node.js. 
I used docker to come up to speed fast. Install docker and run this command:

<code>docker run -p 8086:8086 -v influxdb:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb</code>

## Grafana
If you easily want to have a graphical representation of your sensor datas, go for Grafana.
